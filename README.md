# Basic Keylogger in Python

This repository contains a simple keylogger implemented in Python. Keyloggers are programs designed to capture and log keystrokes typed on a computer keyboard. They can be used for various purposes such as monitoring user activity, debugging software, or in some cases, malicious activities.

## How it Works

This keylogger is implemented using Python and utilizes the `pynput` library to capture keyboard events. It runs in the background and logs keystrokes to a text file.

## Features

- Captures and logs keystrokes.
- Runs silently in the background.
- Logs are saved to a text file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
https://github.com/Rishi-kaul/Keylogger.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install pynput
```

3. Run the keylogger:

```
python keylogger.py
```

4. To stop the keylogger, press `ESC ` in the terminal.
